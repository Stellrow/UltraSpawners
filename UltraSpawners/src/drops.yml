#
#    This config is for the tier based drops part of the spawners
#    The following example should be enough for anyone to replicate
#    The format will be started with the EntityType name (PIG,COW,SHEEP)
#         - Names should be uppercased
#         - Try keeping the tier in order to avoid any possible errors
#    !!More advance options including in-game editor for custom items will be added soon!!
#EntityType(PIG,COW,SHEEP)
    #Tier number(Should always be a number and in increasing order!)
      #Items that should be dropped(as a list,at the moment there is no chance system implemented,so all the items in that list will drop!)

      1:
        - PORKCHOP
      2:
